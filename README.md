Secret Agent watch face for Garmin ConnectIQ - https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/5ee66b09-835b-47a4-a76c-9d234a80e6c4

The perfect watch face for bungee jumping off dams, driving tanks through the city, or boarding a frigate in search of a stolen helicopter. Customizable text and background colors. Orange bar represents progress to step goal. Blue bar represents status of battery. Status is indicated by the following letters being shown: A for alarms, M for messages, and C for connected (to phone). The status can be disabled if it is not desired.

Two faces in one! A a "classic" face which is designed specifically for Garmin watch displays (better contrast between the time and background), and an alternate face that is as close to the source material as possible. The faces can be switched between using the settings in the Garmin Connect phone app or Garmin Express!

Changelog:

* 2.0/2.1 - Created a redesigned face that is truer to the source material. NOTE: This face must be explicitly turned on (disable classic face to see it). It is available in the settings in the Garmin Connect phone app or Garmin Express!
* 1.7 - Fixed a bug where C would show up as P.
* 1.6 - Improved dot placement.
* 1.5 - Added date.
* 1.4 - Added white dial details.
* 1.3 - Fixes for 12 vs. 24 hour clock.
* 1.1/1.2 - Minor updates.
* 1.0 - Initial release.
